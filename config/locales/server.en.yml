      quoting:

          Can you try quoting me when you reply, so I know exactly which part you’re replying to?

          Select the text of whichever &uarr; quote you prefer, and then press the **Quote** button that pops up over your selection – or the **Reply** button at the bottom of this post.

          Below the quote, type a word or two about why you picked that one, because I’m curious :thinking:
